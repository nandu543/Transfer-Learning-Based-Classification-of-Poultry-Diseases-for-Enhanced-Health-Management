# Transfer Learning-Based Classification of Poultry Diseases for Enhanced Health Management

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on applying **transfer learning** techniques for
the classification of poultry diseases. Early detection of poultry
diseases is crucial for improving farm management, reducing economic
losses, and ensuring food security. Traditional disease detection
methods are slow and rely heavily on expert knowledge. By leveraging
pre-trained deep learning models, this project aims to automate and
enhance the disease classification process.

## 🎯 Objectives

-   Develop an AI-based system for poultry disease classification.
-   Utilize **transfer learning** with pre-trained CNN models (ResNet,
    VGG, Inception).
-   Improve accuracy and reduce training time compared to training
    models from scratch.
-   Provide a scalable framework for farm-level health management.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏗️ Methodology

1.  **Dataset Preparation**
    -   Collection of poultry disease images.
    -   Preprocessing: resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
2.  **Model Development**
    -   Transfer Learning with ResNet, VGG, and Inception.
    -   Fine-tuning for poultry disease classification.
3.  **Evaluation**
    -   Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
    -   Confusion matrix for validation.
